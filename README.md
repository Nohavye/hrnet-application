# HRnet Application

Welcome to the brand new HRnet! This is our company's internal application for creating and accessing employee records.

The application has been completely redesigned and now runs on [React](https://fr.legacy.reactjs.org/).

The development project was initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
